            <br>
            <p> 
                The Bleeping Computer news source is a blog site that
                keeps up with latest security threats, technology news, 
                ways to stay protected online, and how to use their 
                computers more efficiently.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contrast:
                    The contrast of the site is solid, with the colors 
                    including different shades of blue as well as white, green, and black. 
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Repetition:
                    The repetition is constant throughout the page. The font sizes for each 
                    individual post have a consistent form and are easy to scroll through if
                    you want to find a particular article.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Alignment:
                    The alignment is uniform with every element and is easy to navigate 
                    through. 
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Proximity:
                    The spacing used in this design creates a sense of inclusion. It gives
                    me a feeling that all the latest updates and bugs are found here as each article
                    has links to other resources about that topic.
                </li>

            <br>
            <p> 
                This site is some marketplace for kids motor toys 
                and looks to be a scam possibly.
            </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contrast:
                    The contrast for this website is absolute garbage. It 
                    spans a multitude of different colors as well as font colors
                    which makes it hard to even read anything.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Repetition:
                    The only repetition I see on this page is the constant outlining
                    of products using a black border. It doesn't distinguish anything
                    apart from other products so I don't see what the use was for that.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Alignment:
                    There is no such thing as alignment on this site. They've got text 
                    running into other text, all of the pictures are different sizes, . The more I 
                    look at it, the more I think this was a real attempt at making amazon 2.0.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Proximity:
                    I'll admit that every picture has text related to it which is enclosed 
                    within a box with black borders. To be serious though this page is a joke.
                    It looks like a collage of all the things my elementary teacher told me to
                    glue to a page that I thought was cool or that I wanted.
