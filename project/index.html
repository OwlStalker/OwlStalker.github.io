            <h1>Flying Bees LLC</h1>

            <p>Flying Bees LLC was established May 10th, 2012. We are a family
               business that raise honey bees and provide other services. You can be 
               assured that when we harvest honey that there is nothing added such 
               as preservatives or additional ingredients and that what comes off 
               the frames is what you pay for. We also raise and sell Queen bees 
               which is how beekeepers are able to raise hives. Other services we 
               offer are hive removals and pollination services. If you have a nest 
               of bees flying around somewhere on the property and want them removed, 
               we can give you a quote for removal. Pollination services are used by 
               farmers all the time which is when we bring our family of bees to a piece 
               of farmed land and they get to work pollinating our clients' crops.
